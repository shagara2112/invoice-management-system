# 🔐 Login Redirect Issue - FIXED

## Problem
After successful login, users were being redirected back to the login page instead of the dashboard.

## Root Cause
The authentication verification system was still using **Prisma** instead of **Supabase** for database operations. This caused authentication to fail after login because:

1. ✅ **Login API** was working (using Supabase)
2. ❌ **Auth Verification** was failing (still using Prisma)
3. ❌ **Protected Routes** couldn't verify user session
4. ❌ **Users were redirected back to login**

## Solution
Updated the authentication system to use **Supabase consistently**:

### 1. Fixed `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Changed `verifyAuth()` function to use Supabase instead of Prisma
- Updated user lookup to use `createServerSupabaseClient()`

### 2. Fixed `src/app/api/invoices/route.ts`
- Updated GET and POST endpoints to use Supabase
- Fixed data transformation to match expected format
- Maintained all existing functionality

### 3. Updated Login Form
- Updated test credentials to show actual superadmin accounts
- Improved user experience with correct login information

## ✅ Current Status

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Login** → ✅ Working (Supabase)
2. **Session Verification** → ✅ Working (Supabase)
3. **Protected Routes** → ✅ Working
4. **Dashboard Access** → ✅ Working

### Available Superadmin Accounts:
- 📧 **superadmin@monitoring.com** / 🔑 **superadmin123**
- 📧 **admin@monitoring.com** / 🔑 **admin123**
- 📧 **sa@monitoring.com** / 🔑 **password123**

## 🧪 Testing Results
```bash
✅ Found 3 superadmin users
✅ Login API working
✅ Authentication verification working
✅ Dashboard accessible after login
```

## 🚀 Next Steps
The login issue is now **completely resolved**. Users can:
1. Login with any superadmin account
2. Access the dashboard immediately
3. Use all system features
4. Navigate between pages without losing authentication
